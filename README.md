# Bamazon
*Creating Database Tables*

### About

In this project the app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

### Getting Started

* First, you will need to clone this repository
* Second, you will need to open terminal for this project and add 'npm install'. You will need to also install 'mysql' and 'inquirer' for this project to work.
* Once all of this is downloaded and added to the repository, you will be able to type 'node bamazonCustomer.js'. This will start the project.

### Running the Store

1. A table will show in the terminal of all the items in the store.
2. The first prompt will ask, **'What item ID would you like to purchase?'**.

4. Customer responds with the amount they would like to buy. The new inventory will then display along with the total purchase amount for the customer.

5. A new prompt will appear at the bottom that asks **'Would you like to shop some more?'** This is when the customer would say yes or no. If the customer says yes, Bamazon will respond **'Great! Shop more!'** and will start asking again the previous questions.

6. If the customer is done shopping, Bamazon will respond with **'Thanks for shopping! Bye!'** and will end the program.
